// BlockProc is the blocking-chain procedure behind the Block tab. It builds
// one row per session with the session it is blocked by; a recursive CTE
// walks that pairing into the indented tree.
//
// The blocker comes from sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks, the rule gosmo's
// sessionBlockerJoin uses for RequestActivity, BlockedRequests and
// ActiveSessions: the longest-waiting task blocked by another session, else
// dm_exec_requests.blocking_session_id. A request running a parallel plan
// waits on its workers (CXCONSUMER, blocking_session_id 0) while the lock wait
// sits on a worker. The proc once read sys.sysprocesses, where that worker is
// an ecid > 0 row with a zero sql_handle: CROSS APPLYing the text dropped the
// row, the parallel reader showed as unblocked and its idle head blocker was
// filtered out — the Block tab showed nothing (review plan 2026-10-16, U1).
// Rejoining sysprocesses by spid also repeated every tree row once per
// thread, so nothing below reads it.
